## Description 
Note Taker application using express and navigating different CRUD operations and endpoints! Thank goodness for the starter code for the front end stuff!
Building the backend from scratch was a bit difficult, I'm still trying to catch up with understanding everything so it's hard since everything has been compounding... but the challenges definitely do help since I have to spend time figuring out what everything does and how they work together! I think routes was the hardest to be honest. Moving things around and changing the endpoints in the different files has me very confused. I wasn't even going to do them originally because they weren't required and I was already struggling with functionality, but then when I asked for help with express, the routes were forced on me and broke my code for a good while. I was debating on reverting it back to one file, but eventually worked through it!
Here I've utilized the CRUD operations GET, POST, and DELETE, with different endpoints. The note taker app take input from the request body (title and text), adds them to an array of note objects, saves it and displays all the saved objects again! You can even target specific notes that you want to delete using request parameters.
